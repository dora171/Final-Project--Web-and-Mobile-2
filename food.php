            Italian food is the healthiest in the world. Italian people spend most of the time on
            choosing and preparing food for a meal. They eat pasta (la pasta on Italian) and lots of
            Venetian vegetables and sauces. Traditional pasta like fussili, spaghetti, fettuccine and cannelloni
            need more time to make, secret is in love and passionate in making pasta. The most popular
            restaurant in Venice is "Trattoria Alla Rampa". Pizza in Venice is probably not the best choice
            to order. In Venice is forbidden to use bread oven because in the past were bunch of fires
            when chefs in the restaurant tried to make a good pizza. When tourists come to Venice, 
            it is the best for them to order their traditional food like: Bigoli in salsa, Fegato alla veneziana. Baicoli
            Baccala mantecato and Sarde in saor. <br><br>Pasta in Italy is very appreciated among Italian people, especially
            to ones who are native Italians. To experience Italian food in the best way, tourists in Venice can try
            street food which is delicious.
            For people who have never eaten traditional Italian food, they should try canelloni.
            Canelloni are pasta filled with meat, mascarpone, parsley, garlic, solt and paper.
            Mixture of all this ingredients is filling canelloni pasta and spill with cream and olive oil.
            There are also two more ways how to do canelloni, one is with salsa cream and the other are
            canelloni filled with spinach.
