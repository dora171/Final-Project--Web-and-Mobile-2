                    In Venice, art is important as much as preparing and eating food. In the city
                    people can go to museums of modern and contemporary art: Ca'Pesaro, Palazzo Grassi
                    Peggy Guggenheim Collection and Punta della Dogana. All museums are either modern and contemporary
                    art or they are in category of historic houses. The most famous glass in Venice is Venetian Glass,
                    it is made in Venice but is primarily from island Murano. Venetian glass is made in a
                    traditional way, which is very complex. The glass is made of silica which becomes liquid
                    when temperature is high. After glass turns from a liquid state into a sold, glass becomes soft
                    and professional maker of the Venetian glass can make different shapes out of glass.
                    The Venetian glass consists of materials like ceramic fluxes, sodium oxide, sodium,
                    nitrate and arsenic and coloring substances. Murano artists use these tools in the
                    period of making a glass: borselle(in eng. tongs), canna da soffio(blowing pipe), pontello(iron), scagno(bench) and tagianti(clippers for cutting).

                    during the year when poor people could experience how it felt like to be
                    the queen or king in marvelous crinoline or cloak. Besides of what they
                    want to be, young men and women were masked to flirt with others, even
                    married couples hid their faces in order to be free for one night. Venetian
                    mask was made of leather, porcelain or glass technique. They were hand-painted
                    with lots of love and imagination. Venice has these types of masks: Bauta, Colombina,
                    Medico delle peste, Moretta, Volto, Pantalone, Arlecchio and Zanni. The mask makers
                    in Venice are called "mascherari", they were one of painters who drew faces on different
                    types of material.
