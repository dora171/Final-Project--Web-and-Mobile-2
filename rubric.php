    <h1 class="rubrics-title">   Grade rubric
    </h1>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Content  </h2>

    <p class="cont">  In the content I used photos which I made during my trip to Venice.
        Some of the photos I took from the google because I did not have them in my
        photo library. I was focused more on the pictures than content. 
    </p>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Navigation  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        I learned how to the navigation from W3 schools because I like that type of navigation the most.
        I combined types of navigation in media queries. I used two colors to make my navigation clearer.
        When the user is on iPad or mobile phone he is able to use scroll navigation.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Organization  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        I sorted my content in four css files to keep better track and my alignment is consistent throughout the website.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Design  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        I used four compatible main colors to combine on each separate page in order to look better. For the comment page I have used additional color
        to look a little bit different.
    </p>
    <br>


    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   HTML/CSS  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        I tested all my web pages on different browsers and it is compatible with all of them, also I tried on different
        device how my web page looks like.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Original JavaScript component  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        For the final project I have used multiple javaScript files. JavaScript is used for navigation, comments, gallery, map and for title animation.
        On the food page I decided to have animated text which will appear immediately when user enters the web site. JavaScript codewhich is used for navigation to become
        active is written on my own. JavaScript code for photo gallery I used from w3Schools.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   DHML component  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        I used javaScript code for majority of my animations and design.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h2 class="rubrics-content">   Corrections from midterm project  </h2>

    <p class="cont">
        From the midterm project scroll navigation for mobile and tablet I have made a new navigation with dropdown for mobile and tablet.
        Then, from three separate pages: art, music, festival and I created new web page Culture web page with three sections. On the normal 
        screen I have adjusted picture to be the same width as paragraph and for smaller devices I increased the font size for easier reading.
        The code is also aligned.
    </p>
