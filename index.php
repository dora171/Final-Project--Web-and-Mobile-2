        <h2 class="ven2">"The average age of people living in the historic city of Venice went up from 40.6 years old (in 1981) to 48.2 (in 2001). Before 1991, more than 60% of the population fell within the 14-59 age bracket, but by 2001 the range had fallen to 58% and the proportion 
            of people age 60 and up stood at almost 35%, significantly higher than 30 years earlier."</h2>
